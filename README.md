# ILGPU.Algorithms

Real-world applications typically require a standard library and a set of standard algorithms that "simply work".
The ILGPU Algorithms library meets these requirements by offering a set of auxiliary functions and high-level algorithms (e.g. sorting or prefix sum).
All algorithms can be run on all supported accelerator types.
The CPU accelerator support is especially useful for kernel debugging.

# Build instructions

ILGPU.Algorithms requires Visual Studio 2019 or higher.

Make sure to init/update the ILGPU git submodule using `git submodule update --init` before building the algorithms library.

Note: T4 (*.tt) text templates must be converted manually depending on the Visual Studio version.
To transform them, right-click a text template and select Run Custom Tool. Alternatively, you can open and save any text template in Visual Studio or choose
"Build->Transform all T4 Templates".
